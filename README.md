# AI-Vehicle-Detection-System
The AI Vehicle Detection System is an intelligent, real-time solution designed to detect and classify vehicles using computer vision and deep learning techniques. This project leverages powerful object detection models like YOLOv5, SSD, or Faster R-CNN to identify vehicles such as cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles from video feeds or images.
